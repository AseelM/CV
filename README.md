## Aseel Mustafa

I am very passionate about women going into tech and as part of my passion I am proud to be part of a social enterprise that wants to change society and the face of the UK economy by teaching 20,000 women how to code for free by the end of 2020.

## Interests

I have an appetite for all things entrepreneurial, start-up and technological; therefore, I am part of many groups including Tech London Advocates, City Starters, Sprint Programme, Croydon Tech City, Code First Girls, Founders & Coders, etc. An avid sportswoman, I play a handful of sports including squash and table tennis. I also excelled in basketball and was captain of my school team throughout my secondary school years. I have recently developed a fondness for boxing and have been regularly practicing for almost 5 years. I have a keen interest in languages.
